    <h1 style="color: blue">Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank</h1>
    <p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were just happy to be involved.</p>

  <p>"I've made new friends, we have a great canteen, and in a few months I'll have earned enough for a deposit on my own kennel"</p>

<h2 style="color: blue">Businesses Suited to Animal Employees</h2>

<p>Many businesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and furry friends in the workplace.</p>

<h3 style="color: blue">Cafes</h3>

<p>Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and be soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some feline friends.</P>

<h3 style="color: blue">Hospitals</h3>

<p>Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a temporary stay.</p>

<h3 style="color: blue">Window Cleaning</h3>

<p>If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.
